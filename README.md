# VDS-2017-Advanced-Configuration-Editor

This Visual Studio project was introduced to Autodesk EMEA reseller channel @OTX 2016, Berlin.
Basically the project has all VDS 2017 configuration files linked from ProgramData's Extension folder. With that each edit is 
reflected in current running sessions.
The advanced configuration editor additionally shares all snippets and templates that might help to quickly reuse functions as well as 
to speed up documentation time, e.g. using the VDS Extension templates to create the supplemental files for extensions.

This Editor is my active tool. Simply subscribe to stay up to date as I am adding all stuff, that I intend to reuse.
